# chemistry-haskell

builds (and installs) for me with ./stackSeq

# notice the .yaml file resolver lts-9.4 and the a version of aeson that it works with is aeson 1.1.2.0

look for executable in
/home/mikeh/chemistry-table-haskell/.stack-work/install/x86_64-linux/lts-9.4/8.0.2/bin

executes as a public exec  but exepects the json file in a specific relative place !
